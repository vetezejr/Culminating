        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>This is a project that I did in grade 9 that was programmed in the Java language. The game begins with the user inputting two numbers and the program will pick a number between those two numbers for the user to guess. The program will inform you how you are doing with each guess, you have 10 guesses.</p>
